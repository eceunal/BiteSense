## 📌 Overview

BiteSense is an **Android application** designed to provide **instant, offline diagnosis of arthropod bites**—including ticks, mosquitoes, spiders, and more—while offering actionable **first-aid guidance**.

The app runs a **fine-tuned Gemma-3n-2B-it multimodal model entirely on-device**, ensuring **privacy**, **low-latency**, and **accessibility** in **rural or low-connectivity environments**.  
No cloud servers. No internet required. Your sensitive images never leave your phone.

## 🌍 Motivation

Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) kill approximately **700,000 people every year** and account for **17% of the global infectious disease burden** [1].  
In **Turkey**, **Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF)** poses a serious risk, particularly in **rural livestock-farming provinces** such as Sivas, Tokat, Yozgat, Gümüşhane, and Tunceli.

Early and accurate bite identification is critical, but access to **specialists** and **internet-dependent AI tools** is limited in these regions. BiteSense bridges this gap by running advanced multimodal AI **fully offline**.
